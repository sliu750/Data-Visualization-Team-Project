    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, creating environmental challenges. 
        Many agricultural practices contribute to environmental degradation. For example, cattle farming and the use of 
        agricultural chemicals release greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. These greenhouse gases trap 
        heat in the atmosphere, worsening air pollution. Overgrazing weakens soil quality and reduces biodiversity, leaving 
        ecosystems vulnerable to disruptions. Additionally, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water sources, 
        jeopardizing human and animal health. To better understand how agriculture has impacted the environment, we'll visualize 
        greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity changes, and water quality trends.

    <h1>Current Status of Agriculture</h1>
    <p>
        A few countries are clearly dominant in terms of agricultural land use, such as China, United States, and Australia. 
        Within a continent, a couple of countries are the main agricultural producers- for example Brazil and Argentina in 
        South America. This is no surprise given their land areas and in some cases, their populations.

    <p>
        But what about agricultural energy consumption? Surely modern farming technology requires energy, whether in the form 
        of electricity or fossil fuels. Here is how worldwide agricultural energy use has changed from 2012 to 2021.

        Pesticide use has displayed some interesting trends over the years. Click on a continent to focus on trends within 
        that continent.

    <p>
        Another important aspect of agriculture is meat production. Here you can see changes in the primary types of meat 
        production (beef, pork, poultry, lamb) over the years, and the countries that are primarily producing those meats.
    </p>

            height="1040" 
            frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>Additionally, these are the leading producers for each of those meat types.</p>

    <h1>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h1>
    <p>
        With this in mind, let's first look at greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases come from sources such as rice 
        production, livestock farming (especially cows), fertilizer production, and fossil fuel consumption. The most 
        common greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases intensify the 
        well-known greenhouse effect, where such greenhouse gases trap heat on the Earth, contributing to rising global 
        temperatures and more extreme weather patterns. It is estimated that around one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gas 
        emissions come from agriculture.
    </p>

            width="1200" 
            height="1040" 
            frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        How much of each greenhouse gas is produced, and what is producing them? In agriculture, methane and nitrous oxide 
        are produced way more than carbon dioxide. It is no surprise that cows, along with animal manure, are largely 
        responsible for methane emissions. Agricultural soil is a leading cause of nitrous oxide emissions, especially in 
        the United States. When nitrate (<span>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup></span>) is converted to nitrogen gas 
        (<span>N<sub>2</sub></span>) in the soil, as part of the nitrogen cycle, nitrous oxide (N₂O) is released.

    <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
    <p>
        Biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the natural processes that sustain life on Earth. Balanced ecosystems are 
        essential for pollination, fresh air and water, healthy soil, and even medicines for illnesses. However, agricultural 
        activities such as extensive use of pesticides and herbicides, overgrazing, deforestation, and monoculture farming 
        jeopardize biodiversity. Society has been growing less and less crop species over time; now, only nine species account 
        for two-thirds of total crop production.

    <h1>Water Usage</h1>
    <p>
        What about water usage? Water is undeniably vital to all life on Earth. Agriculture accounts for about 70% for global 
        water consumption.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        But at the end of day, are the environmental losses justifiable? What have we gained? Here you can see how total 
        factor productivity (TFP), the ratio of aggregate outputs to aggregate inputs, has changed over the last six decades 
        across different regions.
