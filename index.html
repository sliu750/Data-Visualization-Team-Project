        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, creating environmental challenges. 
            Many agricultural practices contribute to environmental degradation. For example, cattle farming and the use of 
            agricultural chemicals release greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. These greenhouse gases trap 
            heat in the atmosphere, worsening air pollution. Overgrazing weakens soil quality and reduces biodiversity, leaving 
            ecosystems vulnerable to disruptions. Additionally, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water sources, 
            jeopardizing human and animal health. To better understand how agriculture has impacted the environment, we'll visualize 
            greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity changes, and water usage trends.
        </p>

        <h1>Current Status of Agriculture</h1>
        <p>
            A few countries are clearly dominant in terms of agricultural land use, such as China, United States, and Australia. 
            Within a continent, a couple of countries are the main agricultural producers- for example Brazil and Argentina in 
            South America. This is no surprise given their land areas and in some cases, their populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            But what about agricultural energy consumption? Surely modern farming technology requires energy, whether in the form 
            of electricity or fossil fuels. Here is how worldwide agricultural energy use has changed from 2012 to 2021.
        </p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <p>
            Another important aspect of agriculture that heavily impacts the environment is meat production. Here you can see changes in the primary types of meat production (beef, pork, poultry, lamb) over the years, and the countries that are primarily producing those meats, and scale at which they accumulate on a global level.
        </p>

        height="800" 
        frameborder="0"></iframe>
        
        <p>
            Additionally, these are the leading producers for each of those meat types. Here we can compare the production levels of each meat type and see the global distribution of meat production. How do the environmental impacts differ between meats primarily produced in one or two countries, such as poultry and pig meat, and meats like sheep meat that are produced more evenly across multiple countries? Does the fact that the United States and the European Union produce most of the meat mean their environmental impacts are the largest? Let's explore how these factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions, influence the environment in the context of meat production continuing below.

<!--         <h1>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h1>

        </div>
        
        <p>
            With this in mind, let's first look at greenhouse gas emissions. The most common greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases intensify the well-known greenhouse effect, where such greenhouse gases trap heat on the Earth, contributing to rising global temperatures and more extreme weather patterns. It is estimated that around one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Livestock production is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions varies from country to country, and even the proportions of greenhouse gases from each type of animal varies across countries.

        <p>
            How much of each greenhouse gas is produced, and what is producing them? In agriculture, methane and nitrous oxide are produced way more than carbon dioxide. It is no surprise that cows, along with animal manure, are largely responsible for methane emissions. Agricultural soil is a leading cause of nitrous oxide emissions, especially in the United States. When nitrate (<span>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup></span>) is converted to nitrogen gas (<span>N<sub>2</sub></span>) in the soil, as part of the nitrogen cycle, nitrous oxide (N₂O) is released.

        <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin: 20px 0;">
            <div style="flex: 2.5; padding-right: 20px;">

            <div style="flex: 2;">
                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    And now how is biodiversity affected?
                    
                    Biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the natural processes that sustain life on Earth. Balanced ecosystems are essential for pollination, fresh air and water, healthy soil, and even medicines for illnesses. However, agricultural activities such as extensive use of pesticides and herbicides, overgrazing, deforestation, and monoculture farming jeopardize biodiversity. Society has been growing less and less crop species over time; now, only nine species account for two-thirds of total crop production. When biodiversity declines, genetic diversity decreases, leaving ecosystems less resilient to environmental shocks such as disease or drought. Infectious diseases harmful to humans, animals, and plants are also more easily spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an agricultural perspective, biodiversity plays a key role in soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and natural pest control, which are vital for sustainable farming practices. Without healthy ecosystems, agriculture becomes more dependent on chemical inputs, further exacerbating environmental damage.
                </p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>
        
         <p>
             There are ways to preserve biodiversity through practices such as crop rotation, polyculture farming (i.e. growing multiple types of crops), no-till farming (which decreases erosion and retains soil moisture), agroforestry (i.e. planting trees on farmland), and supporting pollinators (e.g. birds, bees, butterflies). These approaches not only protect biodiversity but also boost agricultural productivity and sustainability in the long run.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Water Usage</h1>
        <p>
            Water is undeniably vital to all life on Earth. 
            As reported in the United Nations' World Water Development Report (2024), agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, followed by industrial use at around 20% and domestic or municipal use at about 10%.
       <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="water_infograph.png" alt="Agricultural water consumption as proportion of total water usage" style="max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
      </div>

     <p>
         Here you can see how worldwide water use has changed over the years.
     </p>
        <iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/water_use2/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" 
                width="1200" 
                height="800" 
                frameborder="0"></iframe>


         <p>
         To provide a clearer perspective, the amount of water used for agriculture in 2021 was approximately equivalent to the volume of 1.1 billion Olympic-sized swimming pools.
         </p>    
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="infograph_pool.png" alt="water consumption" style="max-width: 1000px; height: auto;">
      </div>
        
        

        <p>
         Excessive water usage can disrupt natural water cycles and diminish water sources such as lakes and rivers, threatening long-term water quality. This highlights the need for sustainable agricultural practices that promote efficient water use and protect water quality.. For example, one actionable step is limiting the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides, whose runoffs contaminate water sources.
     </p>    

        

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            But at the end of day, are the environmental losses justifiable? What have we gained? Here you can see how total 
            factor productivity (TFP), the ratio of aggregate outputs to aggregate inputs, has changed over the last six decades 
            across different regions.
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/6730_Visualizations/TFPRegion?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"

                frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <p>
        This progress demonstrate that agriculture can meet the world's growing demands and we can learn from the countries that achieved large improvements. However, sustainable agriculture- achieving productivity gains while minmizing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting water quality, and preserving biodiversity- remains a critical challenge.
